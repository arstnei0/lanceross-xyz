<Layout title="Projects - Lance Ross" description="Here are all my projects from my GitHub account.">
    <h1>My Projects ðŸ“š</h1>
    <p>
        You can find here all my projects from GitHub. I usually create Web apps
        and Static sites. I don't know how to customize the project cards so
        this design will work for now. You can check all my projects in <a
            href="https://github.com/lancerossdev?tab=repositories"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub</a
        >.
    </p>
    <ul role="list" class="big-card-grid">
        <BigCard
            href="https://github.com/lancerossdev/lanceross-xyz/"
            title="lanceross-xyz"
            body="This is my new website which you are looking right now!"
        />
        <BigCard
            href="https://github.com/lancerossdev/old-website/"
            title="old-website"
            body="This is my old website made with HTML, Sass and a few JavaScript."
        />
    </ul><br />
