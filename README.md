# lanceross.xyz üåé

Hello, this is the source code my new personal website. You can visit it here on [lanceross.xyz](https://lanceross.xyz).
This website is made with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for the Front-end and is hosted using [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
I will try to update this every time I uploaded something like on blogs and projects page or when I encountered an issue I forgot to fix.

You can email me with my email address on my GitHub Profile or [create an Issue](https://github.com/lancerossdev/lanceross-xyz/issues/new) if you think there's something wrong or you want to add something with my website. I will appreciate your help!

## Dev Notes üìù

You can use `npm i` or `pnpm i` to install dependencies. I personally use `yarn` because it's what I use on most of my projects.

`yarn` - Installs dependencies. You can use any of those.

`yarn run dev` - Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`

`yarn run build` - Build your production site to `./dist/`

`yarn run preview` - Preview your build locally, before deploying
