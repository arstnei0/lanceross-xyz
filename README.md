# Personal Website 🌎
Hello, this is there source code my new personal website. You can visit here on [lanceross.xyz](https://lanceross.xyz).
This website is made with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) for the Front-end and is hosted using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).
I will try to update this every time I uploaded something like on blogs and projects page or when I encountered an issue I forgot to fix.

You can email me with my email address on my GitHub Profile if you think there's something wrong with my website. I will appreciate your help!
